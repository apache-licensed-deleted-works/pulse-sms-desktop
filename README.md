# Pulse SMS - Desktop

![preview](artwork/preview.png)

An Electron app that wraps the Pulse web app. With this desktop implementation, you get:

* Native notifications through persistent web socket
* Notification customizations
* Notification snooze support
* Spell check
* Always active window
* Tray/Menu Bar support
* Unread badge support for Mac and Linux
* Hidden menu bar option for Windows and Linux

The desktop app is built on top of Electron's `BrowserView`, rather than Chromium's `webview`.

## Build Instructions

You will need to set up Node.js v12.x. Pulse uses a typical Node development environment.

1. Use Yarn as the package manager (this is a recommendation from the `electron-builder` tool):

```
$ npm install yarn -g
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```

3. Run the app:

```
$ yarn start
```

The app will only run if you have shut down any other instances. To ensure that only one web socket connection is made and managed, only a single instance of Pulse is allowed to run. That means that if you have the production version of the Pulse desktop app running, you won't be able to run a development version at the same time. If you use `yarn start` while that production instance is running, it will simply display the window of that production instance, instead of starting a new instance of the app.

## Packaging Information

To package the apps for each platform:

```
// MacOS (dmg)
$ yarn build-mac

// Windows (installer with 32 and 64 bit support)
$ yarn build-windows

// Linux (deb and AppImage)
$ yarn build-linux
```

To create production releases of the apps, follow these instructions: https://github.com/klinker-apps/pulse-sms-desktop/blob/master/DIST_BUILD_NOTES.md

## Contributing

Please fork this repository and contribute back using [pull requests](https://github.com/klinker-apps/pulse-desktop/pulls). Features can be requested using issues on our Pulse platform issue tracker, rather than creating issues directly on this repo: https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-issues.

This project was originally a JavaScript project and I am not a big fan of JavaScript. As such, the project now uses Typescript. Many things aren't structured in a very Typescript-y way. I will continue to improve this, as I have time. Pull requests would be more than welcome, to make the app more Typescript-y.
